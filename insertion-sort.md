Timmy has a new game. It consists of a bunch of discs. Each of the disc is of the same size, and has a number written on it.
The set came with a frame to place the discs.
Timmy wants to arrange the discs, so that the numbers on them are either equal, or in the increasing order.
Timmy starts with emptying the frame. He places the first disc.
Now he picks up the second disc. It has another number.
